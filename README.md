# 📊 Customer Analysis Dashboard – Power BI Project

## 🧩 Overview

This Power BI project delivers a comprehensive customer analysis by combining sales and campaign data, designed for non-technical stakeholders such as the Head of Sales. It addresses the real-world challenge of joining customer data from two different Excel sources without a unique key, and visualizes meaningful insights through an interactive dashboard.
